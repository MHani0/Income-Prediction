# Income Prediction Model

## An income prediction project is a supervised Artificial Intelligence project that aims to predict the income level or salary of individuals based on various demographic, economic, and employment-related features. The project typically involves collecting and preprocessing a dataset that contains information about the individuals, such as age, gender, education level, occupation, marital status, race, as well as their salary. The dataset is then used to train an artificial intelligence model, with logistic regression, SVM, decision tree and random forest, which can then predict the income level of new individuals based on their features. The model can be evaluated using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as confusion matrix of each classification algorithm to assess its performance and identify areas for improvement.
